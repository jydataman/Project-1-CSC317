Project 1 for csc317.

To run and test code. Copy and paste code into any IDE, that supports java.util.Random and java.util.Arrays.

And make sure the file name is RandomizeInPlace because the class name is RandomizeInPlace.
( or alternatively, just make sure file name and class name match )

I simply left the src code so copying and pasting can be easy to do. Just click on RandomizeInPlace.Java file.
